# HR-Data-Cleaning-and-KPI-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes an HR dataset of 1,000 employees to understand workforce trends, employee attrition patterns, and performance insights using Python and SQL.
The focus is on data cleaning, feature engineering, and KPI-driven analysis to support HR decision-making.

# Business Problem
Employee attrition directly impacts organizational productivity and hiring costs.
This project aims to answer key HR questions such as:

What factors contribute to employee attrition?
How do salary and performance relate to attrition?
Which employee segments are at higher risk of leaving?
